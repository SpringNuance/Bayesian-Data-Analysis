\section*{Bayesian data analysis -- reading instructions 8} 
\smallskip
{\bf Aki Vehtari}

\subsection*{Chapter 8}

In the earlier chapters it was assumed that the data collection is
ignorable. Chapter 8 explains when data collection can be ignorable
and when we need to model also the data collection.
We don't have time to go through chapter 8 in BDA course at Aalto, but
it is highly recommended that you would read it in the end or after
the course. Most important parts are 8.1, 8.5, pp 220--222 of 8.6, and
8.8, and you can get back to the other sections later.

Outline of the chapter 8 (* denotes the most important parts)
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\parsep=0pt\itemsep=2pt}
\item 8.1 Bayesian inference requires a model for data collection  (*)
\item 8.2 Data-collection models and ignorability
\item 8.3 Sample surveys
\item 8.4 Designed experiments
\item 8.5 Sensitivity and the role of randomization (*)
\item 8.6 Observational studies (* pp 220--222)
\item 8.7 Censoring and truncation (*)
\end{list}

Most important terms in the chapter
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\parsep=0pt\itemsep=2pt}
\item observed data
\item complete data
\item missing data
\item stability assumption
\item data model
\item inclusion model
\item complete data likelihood
\item observed data likelihood
\item finite-population and superpopulation inference

\item ignorable designs
\item propensity score
\item sample surveys
\item random sampling of a finite population
\item stratified sampling
\item cluster sampling
\item designed experiments

\item truncation
\item missing completely at random
\end{list}

% Gelman: ``All contexts where the model is fit to data that are not
% necessarily representative of the population that is the target of
% study. The key idea is to include in the Bayesian model an inclusion
% variable with a probability distribution that represents the process
% by which data become observed.''
