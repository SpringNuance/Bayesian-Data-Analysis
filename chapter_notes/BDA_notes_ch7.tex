\section*{Chapter 7}

\subsection*{Outline}
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\parsep=0pt\itemsep=2pt}
\item 7.1 Measures of predictive accuracy
\item 7.2 Information criteria and cross-validation (read instead the article mentioned below)
\item 7.3 Model comparison based on predictive performance  (read instead the article mentioned below)
\item 7.4 Model comparison using Bayes factors
\item 7.5 Continuous model expansion / sensitivity analysis
\item 7.6 Example (may be skipped)
\end{list}

\noindent
Instead of Sections 7.2 and 7.3 it's better to read
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\parsep=0pt\itemsep=2pt}
\item Aki Vehtari, Andrew Gelman and Jonah Gabry (2017). Practical
  Bayesian model evaluation using leave-one-out cross-validation and
  WAIC. \textit{Statistics and Computing}, \textbf{27}(5):1413-1432,
  doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9696-4. \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04544}{arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.04544}.
\item \href{https://mc-stan.org/loo/reference/loo-glossary.html}{LOO
    package glossary} summarises many important terms used in the
  assignments.
\end{list}

\noindent
In Sections 7.2 and 7.3 of BDA, for historical reasons there is a multiplier $-2$ used. After the book was published, we have concluded that it causes too much confusion and recommend not to multiply by $-2$. The above paper is not using $-2$ anymore.\\

\subsection*{Extra material}

\noindent
The following article provides excellent discussion about ``How should I evaluate my modelling choices?'' from a scientific perspective.

\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\parsep=0pt\itemsep=2pt}
\item Videos, slides, notebooks, references
% \item The most relevant for the course is the first part of the
%   talk ``Model assessment, comparison and selection at Master
%   class in Bayesian statistics, CIRM, Marseille''
\item Sections 1 and 5 (less than 3 pages) of
  ``\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10296}{Uncertainty in Bayesian
    Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation Based Model Comparison}'' clarify
  how to interpret standard error in model comparison
\item Cross-validation FAQ
  \url{https://avehtari.github.io/modelselection/CV-FAQ.html} answers
  many frequently asked questions.

\subsection*{Posterior probability of the model vs. predictive performance}

Gelman: ``To take a historical example, I don't find it useful, from a
statistical perspective, to say that in 1850, say, our posterior
probability that Newton's laws were true was 99\%, then in 1900 it was
50\%, then by 1920, it was 0.01\% or whatever. I'd rather say that
Newton's laws were a good fit to the available data and prior
information back in 1850, but then as more data and a clearer
understanding became available, people focused on areas of lack of fit
in order to improve the model.''

Newton's laws are still sufficient for prediction in specific contexts
(non-relative speeds and differences in gravity, non-significant
effects of air resistance or other friction). See more in the course
