- Yes

### Q5 - 1 point

In a), is the reported resulting posterior correct ...?

### Q6 - 1 point

In part b), is there at least one point estimate reported. Sample based estimates are also ok. Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong due to a wrong posterior distribution being used. With the right posterior, mean, median, and mode are all approximately ....

Overall quality of the report

### Q11 -

Does the report follow the formatting instructions?

- Not at all
- Little
- Mostly
- Yes

### Q12 -

### Q13 -

Please provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports, even if there is nothing to say about the technical correctness of the answers. You can also provide feedback on code.
