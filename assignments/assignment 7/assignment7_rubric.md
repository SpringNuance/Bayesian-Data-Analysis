## S4

Overall quality of the report

### Q29

Does the report follow the formatting instructions?

- Not at all
- Little
- Mostly
- Yes

### Q30

In case the report doesn't fully follow the formatting instructions, specify the formatting
instruction that is not followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference
in formatting is visible.

### Q31

Please provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, ﬂow of the responses, ﬁgures,
ﬁgure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing
feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what
they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all nonempty reports, even if there is nothing to say about the technical correctness of the answers. You
can also provide feedback on code.
